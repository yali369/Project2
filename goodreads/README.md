# Analysis of goodreads.csv

## Overview

This analysis was conducted using an automated LLM pipeline. The dataset provided insights into various features, trends, and relationships among variables.

## Key Findings

The analysis conducted on the dataset from Goodreads unfolded a comprehensive exploration of book ratings and their correlation with the number of ratings. Here's a summary of the results obtained and insights derived from the findings:

### Data Overview
- The dataset consists of **10,000 entries** with **23 columns**. 
- Key attributes include `average_rating`, `ratings_count`, and `original_publication_year`.
- Missing values were initially apparent in columns such as `isbn`, `isbn13`, `original_title`, and `language_code`. After handling the missing data, all columns retained complete records.

### Missing Value Handling
- **Initial Missing Values**: Notable missing values were observed in `isbn` (700), `isbn13` (585), `original_title` (585), and `language_code` (1084).
- **Post-Handling**: By dropping three columns (`isbn`, `isbn13`, `original_title`, and `language_code`) with substantial missing values and imputing the mean for `original_publication_year`, the dataset was cleaned successfully. After handling the missing values, all remaining columns contained no nulls.

### Numerical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics indicated that:
  - The average rating across books was roughly **4.0**, with a maximum of **5.0**. 
  - The `ratings_count`, representing the number of ratings a book has received, ranged widely, showing substantial variability in popularity.
- The distributions of numerical values such as `average_rating` and `ratings_count` indicated a slightly left-skewed distribution, which is common in rating systems where most ratings tend to cluster around higher scores.

### Visualization Insights
1. **Histogram of Average Rating**: The distribution of average ratings clustered around 4.0, indicating many popular books tend to receive higher ratings.
2. **Box Plot**: The box plot for `average_rating` revealed a few outliers and reinforced the above findings about overall ratings clustering around the higher end.
3. **Correlation Matrix**: The heatmap highlighted a weak positive correlation (0.0017) between `ratings_count` and `average_rating`, suggesting that while there's a relationship, it isn't strong.

### Regression Analysis
- An OLS regression was performed with `average_rating` as the dependent variable and `ratings_count` as the predictor:
  - **Model Outcome**: The R-squared value was **0.002**, indicating that the model explains only **0.2%** of the variance in average ratings, a sign of insignificance.
  - The coefficients indicated that for every additional rating, the average rating increases slightly, but the effect is negligible and not practically significant.
- **Statistical Significance**: Despite the statistical significance of the coefficient (`P < 0.0001`), the very low R-squared indicates that factors other than rating counts (e.g., the quality of writing, book genre, marketing) might heavily influence ratings.

### Storylines and Insights
- **Highly Rated Books Dominance**: The data suggests that the presence of numerous ratings does not necessarily equate to higher average ratings, hinting at phenomena such as "hype" or "bandwagon" effects in book ratings.
- **Importance of Quality Indicators**: The analysis signifies a need for deeper exploration into factors influencing ratings since the `ratings_count` alone doesn't adequately predict `average_rating`.
- **Potential for Future Features**: Incorporating qualitative data—such as reviews, author metrics, genre categorization, or publication details—could enhance model accuracy and provide greater insights into what truly drives book ratings on platforms like Goodreads.

In summary, while the analysis provided some quantitative insights into Goodreads' rating dynamics, it emphasizes the complexity of reader preferences and the multifaceted nature of book quality perception. Further analysis incorporating diverse features could yield more actionable insights and a better understanding of the book rating system.
